**Subject**: Initial Literature Review & Feasibility Analysis

### Activities
Conducted a comprehensive literature review focusing on the intersection of Machine Unlearning and Geometric Deep Learning.

### Key Findings
*   **Novelty**: No existing research currently combines these two specific approaches.
*   **Hypothesis**: Geometric symmetries could theoretically identify and remove harmful patterns without affecting adjacent knowledge.

### Resources
*   arXiv, ACL Anthology, Nature, MIT News, Anthropic Alignment Blog.

### Action Items
*   Start learning Group Theory fundamentals.
*   Initialize PyTorch environment.
